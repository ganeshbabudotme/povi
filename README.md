# POVI.Toekom.st V0.1

Hello, this is where POVI.Toekom.st lives. 

The Netherlands has 12 provinces. According to the environmental act, which is expected to come into power in 2023, all provinces are expected to have a provincial environmental vision. In the environmental vision, the province lays down its ambitions and policy goals for the physical living environment for the long term. The province establishes 1 environmental vision for the entire territory. In addition, the province can draw up a joint or regional environmental vision together with other municipalities or provinces.

At POVI.Toekom.st I've tried to collect all provincial environmental visions of Dutch provinces, so we can see how the provinces imagine their future.
